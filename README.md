Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here you'll find some of my work and projects.  

#### [University of Helsinki Full Stack Open Progress](https://github.com/r-brunning/fullstack-open)

See my course projects and notes from the University of Helsinki Full Stack Open course. The course covers modern web development, focusing on JavaScript, React, Node.js, and related technologies.

#### [Refactoring Kata](https://github.com/r-brunning/gilded-rose)

This is my solution to the Gilded Rose kata, focusing on refactoring and coding standards. I completed the kata using TypeScript, and I carried out unit testing with Jest.
